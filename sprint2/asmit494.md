### What I did not do
- I did not add any socials because I'm not sure we are still doing that (in contact us)

### Problems I encountered
- Figuring out how Tailwind works
- Perfecting the spacing for the about section was incredibly difficult and took hours

### Files I worked on
- frontend/src/components/footer.jsx
- frontend/src/pages/home.jsx

### What you accomplished
During this sprint, I meticulously took the information provided in our Figma design to create the frontend components and to the exact specifications outlined there. I made the About section describing what our project entails and added an image under neath it partially to eliminate white space. I created the footer component to be used for copyright at the bottom of all of our pages. The Contact Us portion with placeholders for future photos is also something I worked on.
