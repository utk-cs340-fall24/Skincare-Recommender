### What you accomplished
During this sprint, I found a number of datasets online and selected one for our group. I also wrote a short python script to clean up the dataset and make it fit our product schema so it can be used accordingly. It took some time to learn what pandas is for python and this was my second or third time writing a python script. In the next sprint I will tackle a few larger more ambitous tasks regarding the ml model and integration of the dataset with the front end.
