# Sprint 2

Name: Kevin Guo
GitHub ID: kvnguo
Group Name: SkincareRecommender

### What you planned to do
- Issue 12: Set up Mongodb Database (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Skincare-Recommender/issues/12)
- Issue 25: Create API Routes for User and Products (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Skincare-Recommender/issues/25)

### What you did not do
- I don't have the API routes for reviews and recommendations. This is because we haven't determined the specifics of the recomendation requests yet and reviews are not top priority. 

### What problems you encountered
- Setting up database
- Ran into a middlewere issue with connecting the front and backend
- Due to some personal issues, I started very late in the sprint

### Issues you worked on
- [#12](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Skincare-Recommender/issues/12)
- [#25](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Skincare-Recommender/issues/25)

### Files you worked on
- shared/utils/constants.js
- backend/server.js
- backend/utils/database.js
- everything in backend/routes/ 
- everything in backend/controllers/ 
- frontend/src/pages/test.jsx

### What you accomplished
During this sprint, I set up a mongoDB database and structured the backend by implementing CRUD operations for products and users through controllers and routes. This lays the goundwork for connecting the front and backend, they can now communicate with each other.
