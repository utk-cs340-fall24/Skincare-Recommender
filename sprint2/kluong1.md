### What you did not do
I accomplished everything I planned to do.

### What problems you encountered
- I had to finish my issues before others could start theirâ€™s so I felt rushed.

### Issues you worked on
- [18](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Skincare-Recommender/issues/18)
- [26](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Skincare-Recommender/issues/26)
- [29](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Skincare-Recommender/issues/29)

### Files you worked on
- frontend/src/components/navbar.jsx
- frontend/src/pages/home.jsx
- frontend/src/pages/quiz.jsx
- frontend/src/pages/products.jsx
- frontend/src/pages/error.jsx
- frontend/src/images
- frontend/src/App.jsx

### What you accomplished
- I first created the navigation bar component that includes the link to various pages and a search bar. 
- I also started on the homepage by creating the headline. This includes the first text you see when you enter the website, an image to help represent that our website is about skincare, and a button that encourages you to take our skincare quiz. 
- I then set up the routing for all the pages of our website so that when you click certain buttons or links, it will route you to the necessary page rather than doing nothing.
