# Instructions

This project contains a simple HTML and Javascript example to ask a user for their name and greet them. We will be using HTML, Javascript, and CSS in the frontend of our application, and alerts will be useful in case of user error (see what happens if you do not enter a name).

## Setup

To use this project, simply download the files and open 'index.html' into your browser.
