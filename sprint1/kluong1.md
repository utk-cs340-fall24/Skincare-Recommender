### Files you worked on
- frontend/src/components/button.jsx

### What you accomplished
- I created the user flow diagram. I visited various websites and got inspiration for how I wanted the website to be laid out. I had Kevin help me because he created the design doc and I needed an idea of what pages we needed for the website. The user flow diagram helped me plan out the full website so I knew what to design.
- I created the Figma design for the website's homepage. With the figma design, it'll make it easier on us to know what exactly to code and what we need as components to reuse across multiple pages of the website. 
- I created the button component which we will reuse a lot in the quiz page (in the future) and homepage. This makes it easier on us in the future so we don't have to write the same code over and over again.
