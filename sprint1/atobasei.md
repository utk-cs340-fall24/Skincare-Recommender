# Sprint 1

Ahmad Tobasei, atobasei, Skincare Recommender

In this sprint I planned to do the following:
1) learn the frameworks involved including reading all files made and becoming familiar with javascript and html.
2) make a file detailing the machine learning algorithms we can implement and pros and cons of each one: https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Skincare-Recommender/issues/6
3) make a file detailing the machine learning algorithms implementation following our file format https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Skincare-Recommender/issues/20
4) make a file detailing user authentication and how it would be implemented with our application https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Skincare-Recommender/issues/4


What I did not do: I did not work with MongoDB like I originally planned.
The main problems I encountered were due to lack of familiarity with the tools and languages we were using. I was new to almost everything in our project and it was quite overwhelming and difficult to navigate.

the files I worked on were: ML algorithms for project.pdf Integration of Machine Learning Model.pdf and User Auth.pdf

Overall, this sprint was a significant learning experience. While I didn't accomplish everything I set out to do, I gained valuable insights into the frameworks and tools involved in our project. Moving forward, I aim to dedicate more time to practicing with MongoDB and seek additional support from my team to improve my proficiency with the technologies we are using. I will also be working on the ml model next sprint which will give me much more code to do.

I did accomplish all three issues I worked on and did a signifcant amount of research on how to actually implement our ml model and am ready to work on tha very soon.
