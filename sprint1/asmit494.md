# Sprint 1

Group Name: SkincareRecommender

### What you planned to do
- Issue 17: Create Search Bar Component (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Skincare-Recommender/issues/17)

### What you did not do

### What problems you encountered
- Was not able to make more issues because documentation had to be done first
- Attempted to use debounce with search bar but it made reusability too difficult
- Didn't know how to design the website without a design doc
- Was asked to center the search bar but I've never used Tailwind before

### Issues you worked on
- [#17](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Skincare-Recommender/issues/17)

### Files you worked on
- frontend/src/components/searchbar.jsx
- frontend/src/App.jsx

### What you accomplished
- I created a working search bar component that just requires connection to an API endpoint to work. I also provided an example implementation to make future usages easier that also proves it works by outputting the input to the console.
