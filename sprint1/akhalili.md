# Sprint 1

Alan Khalili, AlanKha, Skincare Recommender

### What I planned to do
I planned to do the following issues for this sprint:

- [#1 Create React Template](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Skincare-Recommender/issues/1)

- [#10 Create System Architecture Diagram](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Skincare-Recommender/issues/10)

- [#15 Set up file structure for project](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Skincare-Recommender/issues/15)

### What you did not do

Origionally, I was planning to d othe backend completely in python using Flask, but after talking it over with my team we decided to have a JS backend seperate from our Python Recommender.

### What problems you encountered
The main problem we encountered, and the reason we did not end up going with a python backend is performance.
With this project, we are very space limited since we want to host the db on the cloud without paying extra, so we had to make a lot of choices to prioritize optimization.

### Issues you worked on
As well as working on the issues listed above, I helped on one other issue:

- [#16 Create Button Component](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Skincare-Recommender/issues/16) in this issue, we added Tailwind CSS to the project. Since I had experience with tailwind in my portfolio website, I helped get started with the framework.


### Files you worked on
- ```Skincare-Reccommender/frontend```(Created the template with vite as well as file structure)
- ```Skincare-Reccommender/backend``` (Created the backend template as well as file structure)

- ```Skincare-Reccommender/recommender```(Created the main.py Flask API endpoint as well as file structure)

### What you accomplished

In this sprint, I completed several key tasks to establish the foundation of the project. Mainly, I created the initial templates for the frontend/backend/recommender. I also organized the folder structure to maintain a clear and scalable architecture for future development. This included setting up necessary configurations and installing essential libraries like React, Flask, Express.js, and Tailwind CSS. I also helped integrate Tailwind CSS into the project which will hopefully aid in the development velocity for our frontend team.
