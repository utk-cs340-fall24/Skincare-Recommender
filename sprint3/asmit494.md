# Sprint 3

- Name: Annalise Smith
- Github ID: asmith7939
- Group Name: SkincareRecommender

### What you planned to do
- Issue 48: Create Products Page (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Skincare-Recommender/issues/48)
- Issue 49: Create Products Details Modal Component (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Skincare-Recommender/issues/49)

### What you did not do
- I did not do a third issue, the other things that needed to be done were dependent on other people getting their issues done.

### What problems you encountered
- Waiting on people was problematic but it was also incredibly difficult to work with the products page and modal, because someone replaced the test data six hours before the demo which threw off all my logic. So now I have to rework everything.

### Issues you worked on
- [48](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Skincare-Recommender/issues/48)
- [49](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Skincare-Recommender/issues/49)


### Files you worked on

- frontend/src/pages/product.jsx
- frontend/src/components/productModal.jsx
- frontend/index.html

### What you accomplished
- I was able to create the products page to be user friendly and visually appealing, and some of the sorting and filtering still works.
- I was able to create a modal to display the rating with stars and ingredient details for each product.
