# Sprint 3

- Name: Kelly Luong
- Github ID: luongkelly
- Group Name: SkincareRecommender

### What you planned to do
- Issue 43: Make authentication pages look good (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Skincare-Recommender/issues/43)
- Issue 47: Create Quiz Page (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Skincare-Recommender/issues/47)
- Issue 50: Create Profile Modal (https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Skincare-Recommender/issues/50)

### What you did not do
- I planned to do the profile modal, however, I had to wait on another issue before I could start creating the profile modal. The other issue wasnâ€™t completed on time so I was not able to create the profile modal.

### What problems you encountered
- I had to wait for others to finish their issues before I could start my issues.

### Issues you worked on
- [43](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Skincare-Recommender/issues/43)
- [47](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Skincare-Recommender/issues/47)
- [50](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Skincare-Recommender/issues/50)


### Files you worked on
(Give a bulleted list of the files in your github repo that you worked on. Give the full pathname.)
- frontend/src/pages/login.jsx
- frontend/src/pages/logout.jsx
- frontend/src/pages/signup.jsx
- frontend/src/components/promptLogin
- frontend/src/pages/quiz.jsx
- frontend/src/pages/results.jsx
- frontend/src/context/quizQuestions.js
- frontend/src/context/theme.js

### What you accomplished
- I was able to design and create the login, sign up, log out page as well as the prompt login component. This makes it so users are able to create an account.
- I created the quiz page with surveyjs and once completed, it will take the user to the results page.
