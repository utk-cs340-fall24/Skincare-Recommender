# Sprint 3

Alan Khalili, AlanKha, Skincare Recommender

### What you planned to do

I wanted to finish my user authentication for firebase and make the frontend more mobile friendly

### What you did not do
- I only did two issues for making the frontend more mobile friendly, and there are still some pages lacking like about us, contact, etc.

### What problems you encountered

For some things like the taskbar, I realized I needed to use a lot of complicated css rules to get it to look good.

### Issues you worked on

- [#45 User Creation/Verification on Sign up/Log in](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Skincare-Recommender/issues/45)
- [#63 Make navbar mobile friendly](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Skincare-Recommender/issues/63)
- [#56 Temporary Photos for Contact Us Section](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Skincare-Recommender/issues/56)

### Files you worked on

- ```/frontend/src/pages/signup.jsx```
- ```/frontend/src/components/navbar.jsx```
- ```/frontend/src/pages/home.jsx```

### What you accomplished

I acomplished all of the issues that I assigned myself. Mainly I worked on frontend, but I also was working with the backend for api calls.
